; An Eta dialogue focused around a patient-doctor interaction: after an introduction, the
; doctor may initiate conversation with a question. Otherwise, the patient has a list of
; questions on his agenda to ask the doctor (each one may spiral to various sub-dialogues
; before returning to the overall conversation track).
;
; 1. SOPHIE acted as a real cancer patient.
; 2. SOPHIE was able to show her concerns.
; 3. I did not understand what SOPHIE was saying about her prognosis.
; 4. I was given at one opportunity where SOPHIE needed a clarification.
; 5. I was able to discuss the treatment options with SOPHIE.
; 6. During the conversation I think there was chance of being empathetic.
; 7. I ended the conversation with a positive note without giving false hope.
; 8. I think SOPHIE understood her prognosis.
;
; A couple low cognitive load questions to start with
; Medicine/addition concerns, "how do I know if it's working?"
; "Pain medicine doesn't work, need something stronger?"
; "What are my choices at this point?"
; If chemotherapy not mentioned, ask about it
; "Be honest - what kind of time are we looking at?"
; If hospice not mentioned, ask about it
; What to tell family?

                        a conversation with you\. I just moved back into the area from Florida about two weeks ago\. I was recently
                        diagnosed with lung cancer\, and finished radiation about a month ago\. My pain seemed to be under
                        control for a while\, but it seems to be getting worse now\. I\'m meeting with you today to help
                        get some questions answered about my options and my future\.))


?a10. (Me say-to.v you '(One thing I\'ve noticed in the last few weeks is that I haven\'t been sleeping very well\. Most nights I
                        have to take medication for my pain\. I\'m not sure if it\'s only the pain\, but I keep waking up at night\.
                        Do you know why that is?))
