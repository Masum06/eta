; An Eta dialogue focused around a simple doctor-patient discussion, intended to test the integration
; of GPT-3 with response generation.
;
; The dialogue follows a simple sequence of phases:
; 1. The patient asks about her pain (proceeds once doctor is sufficiently empathetic)
; 2. The patient asks about her prognosis (proceeds once doctor is sufficiently explicit)
; 3. The patient asks about her treatment options (proceeds once the doctor is sufficiently empowering)
; 4. The patient tries to close the conversation (ends once the doctor says some variant of "goodbye")
