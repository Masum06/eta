;; ================================================
;;
;; A module for resolving coreferences (currently in
;; development)
;;
;; TODO: The approach that I have is extremely hacky and a bit
;; ad-hoc. It needs to be replaced by a more rigorous approach
;; such as using discourse representation structures, centering
;; theory, etc.
;;
;; Some example sentence sequences that this seems to work
;; correctly on now:
;;
;; Is the Texaco block above the Nvidia block?
;; Is it below [that block]/[it]?
;;
;; Is the Texaco block above the Nvidia block?
;; Is it above the Starbucks block?
;; Is it above the SRI block?

; introduce a discourse entity that may be referred to by a future reference.
;
; TODO: This categorization doesn't make much sense currently. Indefinite articles
; like "a red block" should also introduce discourse entities, but these are also less
; commonly referred to in future spatial questions,
; e.g. "Is a red block on top of the Nvidia block ?"
;      "Is a blue block on top of it ?"
; The "it" here most plausibly refers to the Nvidia block, not the red block.
; There is another issue here too, if instead the follow-up question was
; "Is a blue block on top of that block ?", then it would plausibly refer to the
; red block from the previous question. However, currently I treat "that block" and "it"
; synonymously, indefinite noun phrases aren't stored as discourse entities, and there's no
; way to incorporate the additional information about the block referred to by "a red block"
; if, for example, the system's response was "Yes, the Nvidia block."
