Hi Zahra (cc Len),

Just a heads up that I made some changes to make Lissa compatible with SBCL (it will still work with ACL too), as well as a few minor things such as moving the gist-kb files to their own directory and fixing a bug that made it so that only one gist clause was being added to the file in the day1 session. The newest version is Code-Ver19-May29.

Also, would it be okay if I move the Lissa code (for the elderly version) to a Github repo for future development? I find that a bit easier to work with than Dropbox, but I'm not sure if there was a previous reason for choosing Dropbox instead of that.

Best,
Ben
