Not sure if for between-questions, I omission of "there" causes no problems.
Test miscellaneous "imperfect examples requiring the fall-back rules.

 Many of the "how many" questions don't appear to be working though, even the example queries in the comments.

A couple other assorted ones I tried that are currently not being parsed correctly (although the fallback rules are working here):
' IS THERE A GREEN BLOCK BETWEEN THE HIGHEST RED BLOCK AND THE NVIDIA BLOCK ?'
' WHICH BLUE BLOCK IS THE RIGHTMOST RED BLOCK IN FRONT OF ?'

Actually, if I try "IS THERE A GREEN BLOCK BETWEEN THE SRI BLOCK AND THE TEXACO BLOCK ?" it fails to get a match, and the fallback rules don't work there either.

Best,
Ben
