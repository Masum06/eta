  ; The following "choice packet" defined below is parsed into a rule tree,
  ; which matches patterns recursively:
  ; If a particular pattern fails to match to the input, the pattern matching
  ; algorithm will backtrack and attempt to match the next sibling, and so on.
  ; If no patterns at some depth successfully match, the algorithm backtracks
  ; to the previous level of patterns and continues. The top-level (0) pattern
  ; (scroll down to the bottom of the choice packet), which matches anything,
  ; ensures that if no pattern is matched, a special "NIL Gist" will be extracted.
