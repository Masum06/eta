; "rules-for-between-questions.lisp"  -- currently under revision, June 21/19
; This is the file for "between" rules. These are a bit tricky, because 
; the complement of "between" either can be a plural ("between two red
; blocks") or a full NP conjunction ("between a red block and a blue
; block"), or a conjunction with ellipsis ("between a red and a blue
; block"; "between the Toyota and the SRI block"; "between the Toyota
; and SRI blocks").
